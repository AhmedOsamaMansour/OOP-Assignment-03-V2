     Question 1:
        What is the primary purpose of an interface in C#?
        a) To provide a way to implement multiple inheritance    (Right Answer)
        b) To define a blueprint for a class                     (Most Right Answer)
        c) To declare abstract methods and properties
        d) To create instances of objects

        Question 2:
        Which of the following is NOT a valid access modifier for interface members in C#?
        a) private                                               (Right Answer)
        b) protected
        c) internal
        d) public

        Question 3:
        Can an interface contain fields in C#?
        a) Yes
        b) No                                        (Right Answer)
        c) Only if they are static
        d) Only if they are readonly

        Question 4:
        In C#, can an interface inherit from another interface?
        a) No, interfaces cannot inherit from each other
        b) Yes, interfaces can inherit from multiple interfaces                 (Right Answer)
        c) Yes, but only if they have the same methods
        d) Only if the interfaces are in the same namespace
        Question 5:
        Which keyword is used to implement an interface in a class in C#?
        a) inherit
        b) use
        c) extends
        d) implements                                                          (Right Answer using colon :)

        Question 6:
        Can an interface contain static methods in C#?
        a) Yes
        b) No                                                            (Right Answer) but we can do it using abstract static 
        c) Only if the interface is sealed
        d) Only if the methods are private

        Question 7:
        In C#, can an interface have explicit access modifiers for its members?
        a) Yes, for all members
        b) No, all members are implicitly public                                     (Right Answer)
        c) Yes, but only for abstract members
        d) Only if the interface is sealed

        Question 8:
        What is the purpose of an explicit interface implementation in C#?
        a) To hide the interface members from outside access
        b) To provide a clear separation between interface and class members            (Right Answer)
        c) To allow multiple classes to implement the same interface
        d) To speed up method resolution


        Question 9:
        In C#, can an interface have a constructor?
        a) Yes, but it must be private
        b) No, interfaces cannot have constructors                                   (Right Answer)
        c) Yes, but only if the interface is sealed
        d) Only if the constructor is static

        Question 10:
        How can a C# class implement multiple interfaces?
        a) By using the "implements" keyword
        b) By using the "extends" keyword
        c) By separating interface names with commas                               (Right Answer)
        d) A class cannot implement multiple interfaces
